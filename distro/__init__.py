The ``distro`` package (``distro`` stands for Linux Distribution) provides
information about the Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable
machine-readable distro ID, or version information.

It is a renewed alternative implementation for Python's original
:py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, but it provides much more
functionality. An alternative implementation became necessary because Python
3.5 deprecated this function, and Python 3.7 is expected to remove it
altogether. Its predecessor function :py:func:`platform.dist` was already
deprecated since Python 2.6 and is also expected to be removed in Python 3.7.
Still, there are many cases in which access to Linux distribution information
is needed. See `Python issue 1322 <https://bugs.python.org/issue1322>`_ for
more information.

    sources than the original function, and that may lead to different data if
    the Linux distribution is not consistent across multiple data sources it
    provides (there are indeed such distributions ...).

    Another reason for differences is the fact that the :func:`distro.id`
    method normalizes the distro ID string to a reliable machine-readable value

    If you have a need to get distros for reliable IDs added into this set,
    or if you find that the :func:`distro.id` function returns a different
    distro ID for one of the listed distros, please create an issue in the
    `distro issue tracker`_.

    **Lookup hierarchy and transformations:**

    First, the ID is obtained from the following sources, in the specified
    order. The first available and non-empty value is used:

    * the value of the "ID" attribute of the os-release file,

    * the value of the "Distributor ID" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,

    * the first part of the file name of the distro release file,

    The so determined ID value then passes the following transformations,
    before it is returned by this method:

    * it is translated to lower case,

    * blanks (which should not be there anyway) are translated to underscores,

    * a normalization of the ID is performed, based upon
      `normalization tables`_. The purpose of this normalization is to ensure
      that the ID is as reliable as possible, even across incompatible changes
      in the Linux distributions. A common reason for an incompatible change is
      the addition of an os-release file, or the addition of the lsb_release
      command, with ID values that differ from what was previously determined
      from the distro release file name.

    If *pretty* is true, the version and codename are appended.

    codename is non-empty (e.g. "7.0 (Maipo)").

    Some distributions provide version numbers with different precisions in
    the different sources of distribution information. Examining the different
    sources in a fixed priority order does not always yield the most precise
    version (e.g. for Debian 8.2, or CentOS 7.1).

    version:

    If *best* is false, the first non-empty version number in priority order of
    the examined sources is returned.

    If *best* is true, the most precise version number out of all examined
    sources is returned.

    **Lookup hierarchy:**

    In all cases, the version number is obtained from the following sources.
    If *best* is false, this order represents the priority order:

    * the value of the "Release" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,
    * the version number parsed from the "<version_id>" field of the first line
      of the distro release file,
